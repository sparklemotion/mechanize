= WWW::Mechanize examples

== Google
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'
  
  agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
  agent.user_agent_alias = 'Mac Safari'
  page = agent.get("http://www.google.com/")
  search_form = page.forms.with.name("f").first
  search_form.q = "Hello"
  search_results = agent.submit(search_form)
  puts search_results.body

== Rubyforge
  require 'mechanize'
  
  agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
  page = agent.get('http://rubyforge.org/')
  link = page.links.text(/Log In/)
  page = agent.click(link)
  form = page.forms[1]
  form.form_loginname = ARGV[0]
  form.form_pw = ARGV[1]
  page = agent.submit(form, form.buttons.first)
  
  puts page.body

== File Upload
This example uploads one image as two different images to flickr.

 require 'rubygems'
 require 'mechanize'
 
 agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
 
 # Get the flickr sign in page
 page  = agent.get('http://flickr.com/signin/flickr/')
 
 # Fill out the login form
 form  = page.forms.name('flickrloginform').first
 form.email = ARGV[0]
 form.password = ARGV[1]
 page  = agent.submit(form)
 
 # Go to the upload page
 page  = agent.click page.links.text('Upload')
 
 # Fill out the form
 form  = page.forms.action('/photos_upload_process.gne').first
 form.file_uploads.name('file1').first.file_name = ARGV[2]
 agent.submit(form)
  
== Pluggable Parsers
Lets say you want html pages to automatically be parsed with Rubyful Soup.
This example shows you how:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'
  require 'rubyful_soup'

  class SoupParser < WWW::Mechanize::Page
    attr_reader :soup
    def initialize(uri = nil, response = nil, body = nil, code = nil)
      @soup = BeautifulSoup.new(body)
      super(uri, response, body, code)
    end
  end

  agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
  agent.pluggable_parser.html = SoupParser

Now all HTML pages will be parsed with the SoupParser class, and automatically
give you access to a method called 'soup' where you can get access to the
Beautiful Soup for that page.

== Using a proxy

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'
  
  agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
  agent.set_proxy('localhost', '8000')
  page = agent.get(ARGV[0])
  puts page.body

== The transact method

transact runs the given block and then resets the page history. I.e. after the
block has been executed, you're back at the original page; no need count how
many times to call the back method at the end of a loop (while accounting for
possible exceptions).

This example also demonstrates subclassing Mechanize.

  require 'mechanize'

  class TestMech < WWW::Mechanize
    def process
      get 'http://rubyforge.org/'
      search_form = page.forms.first
      search_form.words = 'WWW'
      submit search_form

      page.links.with.href( %r{/projects/} ).each do |link|
        next if link.href =~ %r{/projects/support/}

        puts 'Loading %-30s %s' % [link.href, link.text]
        begin
          transact do
            click link
            # Do stuff, maybe click more links.
          end
          # Now we're back at the original page.

        rescue => e
          $stderr.puts "#{e.class}: #{e.message}"
        end
      end
    end
  end

  TestMech.new.process

== Client Certificate Authentication (Mutual Auth)

In most cases a client certificate is created as an additional layer of security
for certain websites.  The specific case that this was initially tested on was
for automating the download of archived images from a banks (Wachovia) lockbox 
system.  Once the certificate is installed into your browser you will have to 
export it and split the certificate and private key into separate files. Exported
files are usually in .p12 format (IE 7 & Firefox 2.0) which stands for PKCS #12.
You can convert them from p12 to pem format by using the following commands:

openssl.exe pkcs12 -in input_file.p12 -clcerts -out example.key -nocerts -nodes
openssl.exe pkcs12 -in input_file.p12 -clcerts -out example.cer -nokeys

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'

  # create Mechanize instance
  agent = WWW::Mechanize.new
  
  # set the path of the certificate file
  agent.cert = 'example.cer'
  
  # set the path of the private key file
  agent.key = 'example.key'

  # get the login form & fill it out with the username/password
  login_form = @agent.get("http://example.com/login_page").form('Login')
  login_form.Userid = 'TestUser'
  login_form.Password = 'TestPassword'
  
  # submit login form
  agent.submit(login_form, login_form.buttons.first)

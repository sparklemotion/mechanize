== Description

The Mechanize library is used for automating interaction with websites.

submitted.  Mechanize also keeps track of the sites that you have visited as
a history.

* nokogiri[http://nokogiri.rubyforge.org]

== Support:

The mechanize mailing list is available here:

The bug tracker is available here:

* https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize/issues

file.

== Developers

To run the tests for the first time:

  gem install hoe rake
  rake newb

This will install all the required dependencies for running the tests.  For
subsequent test runs:

  rake test

You can also use +autotest+ from the ZenTest gem to run tests.

See also Mechanize::TestCase to read about the built-in testing
infrastructure.

This library comes with a shameless plug for employing me
(Aaron[http://tenderlovemaking.com/]) programming Ruby, my favorite language!

== Acknowledgments

This library was heavily influenced by its namesake in the Perl world.  A big
thanks goes to {Andy Lester}[http://petdance.com],
the author of the original Perl module WWW::Mechanize which is available
here[http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/].  Ruby Mechanize would not be around without you!

Thank you to Michael Neumann for starting the Ruby version.  Thanks to everyone
who's helped out in various ways.  Finally, thank you to the people using this
library!
